      <h1>Library of Twitter</h1>
      <p>This project is derived from "The Library of Babel".</p>
      <p>
        "The Library of Babel" is a short story by the Argentine author and
        librarian Jorge Luis Borges (1899–1986), which envisions a universe in
        the form of an immense library containing all possible 410-page books of
        a specific format and character set.
      </p>
      <p>
        The story was originally published in Spanish in Borges' 1941 collection
        of stories, "El jardín de senderos que se bifurcan" (The Garden of
        Forking Paths). The entire book was subsequently included in his
        extensively reprinted work "Ficciones" (1944). Two English-language
        translations appeared almost simultaneously in 1962: one by James E.
        Irby in a diverse collection of Borges's works titled "Labyrinths," and
        the other by Anthony Kerrigan as part of a collaborative translation of
        the entirety of "Ficciones".
